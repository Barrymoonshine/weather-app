## Summary

Whatever The Weather is a simple web application that allows users to search for the weather in a chosen location.

The headline weather results are then displayed to the user alongside an icon and giph to illustrate the current forecast.

Weather data and the Giph are collected using API calls.

This project was made as part of the [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) full stack javascript curriculum.

## Key learning points

- Calling APIs using the async and await javascript keywords
- Processing API responses using .json and object dot notation
- Creating a toggle button to switch between temp measurements
- Rolling back to a previous git commit due to a file becoming corrupted
